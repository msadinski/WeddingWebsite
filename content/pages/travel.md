Title: Travel

Revolution Brewing is located in the Logan Square neighborhood. It is a two-minute walk from the California Blue Line train station. The ceremony and reception will be held in the Brewer's Lounge upstairs. Please do not get confused with their other location on Kedzie Ave in Avondale. This is the wrong one!
